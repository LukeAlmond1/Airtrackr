FORM HANDLING
### Home Page ~ User enters flight details
This page is where users can input their flight details to see further information about the locations, airports and flight routes associated with their flights. The date input fields ensure that, upon a user clicking the discover details button, the return date is not before the departure date as to allow our api routes to fetch data effectively. The airports and airline inputs have a built-in auto suggest search feature which suggests search queries every time the respective input fields change.
